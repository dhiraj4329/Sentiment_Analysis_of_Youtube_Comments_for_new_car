19,boot space is kinda less
20,ugh! interoirs are a cheap shiny mess. awaiting VW Taigun!

54,Poor interior of car
55,Price should not exceed more than 10 lakh...if price is high then no chances most of family in india is hand to mouth
56,Thank you for the detailed tour of the car!
57,If they put up the price up then seltos or creta then they are on the lesser sales sides as their service charges are higher too similarly the case with taigun
58,First show the car fully ..your videos are so close ok
59,If diesel is not offered it can’t make it big
60,Magnite is better then khusaq

91,"Hello Everyone, as i have heard Mr. Zac Hollis in many interviews ....he seems confident about his 2.0 plans.... if Skoda India introduces 1) Premium Hatchback 5 seater (ex. Fabia) = 5.99 for Base - 8.99 for Top Variant.  2) Small SUV (Kushaq - 5 seater) = 7.99 for Base -12.99 for Top Variant. 3) Entry Level sedan 5 seater = 7.49 Base - Top Variant 12.99. 4) Premium Level sedan 12.99 Lac Base - Top Variant 17.99 Lac. 5) Premium SUV 5 Seater = 15.99 Lac Base - Top Variant 18.99 Lac. 6) Entry Level SUV 7 Seater = 19.99 Lac Base - Top Variant 24.99 Lac. if this strategy is followed even only with petrol engines skoda will do a better job in india. The current sales will be doubled in next 2 years and every year the growth of 15-20 % can be seen"

139,"They'll screw up again with pricing.  They are going after jeep , NOT creta or seltos."
140,Price?
141,What's the expected price ?
142,Ask VW and Skoda India why diesels are not being launched in India even when they are using Euro 6 diesels in Europe.
143,Skoda can win if they intelligently place 2 variants out of 5 under 10L. They can actually out perform everyone with this price strategy.
144,Safety is the only concern.. hopefully they have not compromised on that..
145,If they priced this between 9 to 14 lakhs it will eat creta and seltos
146,"Spare wheel of smaller size is like a very disappointing thing for me 
I believe they could do better in it"
147,What is the kmpl of this car

151,Did you see any options on ambient lighting like octavia? Zac Hollis mentioned that kushaq will come with ambient lighting but not a single review covered it so far
152,Grill copied from Kia Seltos

172,This is 1.0 l engine right ?
173,Bootspace extra 100 litres means it will win definitely❤️👍
174,VW ki saari cars quality ki to hain ye to mana padega
175,"Skoda and Volkswagen after sale services are horrible and too expensive spare parts.
Better to buy Toyota or Honda more reliable vehicles and they also provide very good safety features.
Dont waste money on these brands.
Can really save lots."
176,Price will be the deciding factor
177,"संस्कृत name , intresting 🔥🤩"

CRETA MAY GET THE SAME RATING BECAUSE BOTH SHARE THE SAME PLATFORM. FEARING THAT ,HYUNDAI TILL NOW DID NOT SEND CRETA FOR NCAP CRASH TEST. REMEMBER THAT NEXON WHICH IS A SEGMENT BELOW GOT 5 STARS AND NISSAN MAGNITE GOT 4 STARS. KUSHAQ MAY DEFINITELY GET A 5 STAR RATNG."
196,Skoda should be provide diesel engine..
197,10:50 V3 cars' rugged phone
198,Car looks so premium! Price 😂 india:- baad mah aana...Maruti Alto 800 😎💰
199,I think tata Nexon is better than kushaq
200,Price kab unveil hoga??
201,The sunroof extends further if you keep the button pressed. My fabia has same feature that's why I am saying that.
202,Skoda=audi= volkswagen
203,"Skoda went from names like Octavia Fabia Superb to Karoq Kushaq Kamiq. 

VW went from Polo Jetta Passat to Taigun Tiguan TRoc.

Mahinda and Tata still rolling on with Thar and Safari."
204,Can't beat CRETA
205,"Tell Skoda guys dont be greedy, 1st launch the car with very low price since 90% parts are localization,  rest this youtubers wont make your car premium unless Skoda doesn't think like Maruti

206,No one will buythis car...
207,Skoda karoq ki information baatayi .

211,Was waiting for ur video only finally 🔥🔥 i love it
212,Why Skoda is not coming with diesel engines
213,Sad that this car will fail in front of Creta just coz of the reason that it doesn't have a panaromic roof
214,Car is good but hope Skoda didnt price it just like karoq which make good product flop.
215,I have Skoda rapid tsi service price is effordable and experience is also good ❤️
216,Altroz xz  variant
217,"A Skoda which looks Kia from inside. Quality compromise nhi krna chahiye yr , uske liye hyundai vgerah already hai"
218,Service quality is a big question.
219,"Guys please check the dealer. If he is really trustworthy only then put your foot forward.
After doing so much research on which car we should finally buy, we opted for Skoda Rapid style automatic Petrol, and here are we today regretting for the same.
Think twice before you buy.
After sales service from Skoda is pathetic.
From day one there is some or the other problem but no one to rescue.
Dealer gave me fake price quotation, & cheated more than 75000/- 
Also not gave us the second key of my car. 
Collected 1% TCS i.e. 12000/- as per government norms & didn’t deposited in government till date.
I am feeling completely cheated by Skoda and do not know what to do with my car.
So, request all those who plan to buy Skoda to reconsider their decision and ensure they have adequate reasons to buy."
220,"Very poor and low quality interior, at least for top model quality should have kept better
This looks competition for venue and sonet and not for creta/seltos"
221,"Even though the pricing is competitive, the quality doesn't looks great. There's nothing fascinating about the interiors. That standard set by Creta, Seltos, Harrier and Hector, this doesn't comes close. German car k naam par sub standard product."
222,Skoda 2.0 flop hote hue nazar aah raha hai
223,Seltos>>kushaq

225,Skoda kushaq same as look like Creta 2017

243,What kind of review is this? Why are there comments without familiarising about the features? Amateurish.
244,Arun Panwar :- Kia kyu nahi lii ?
245,Flop show just like Kicks. Its dimensions are on par with Brezza and Venue. They should have squeezed it into Sub 4m or should fight with S cross. No chance against Creta and Seltos
246,Wow! great quality of camera👍🏾
247,Instead of buying this i can spend 2 more lks and go for the beast tata harrier
248,"It's a jackedup fabia. Small, Karoq would have been ideal size. Rather than making a new one, Karoq could have been localised, with an diesel option."

311,"I think they should have launched it in diesel varient also , otherwise this is car is amazing, going to give a tough competition to creta and seltos.

328,Show a full view of car atleast so that we can see watever you are saying
329,"just don't be too happy about it....
the model you are seeing cost around 19-20 lacs on road , that too in petrol....

Real competition against Creta/Seltos would be of :
Base model features ,  
petrol mileage and 
right pricing...."
330,Seltos is way way better in terms of features and looks and engine options

332,"Ok so few things almost all the reviewers missed are that this is a Skoda and not a Hyundai of Kia. So features like pan sunroof, digital cockpit, all LED light setup in front and back, smaller bezel and a larger screen for infotainment would come as an update features in upcoming years to keep the car refresh. And Škoda has cleverly kept the relevant features like venti seats and a sunroof to give a dent to rivals. Maybe Škoda should roll a VRS variant as well 😅."
333,1 litter engine torq is 175 nm
334,If on road 12 to 18...this is the car U have to buy instead creta and seltos
335,Creta still stands tall 🤟🏻🔥. If this is the top model here then even creta sx provides better vfm than this.
336,Nice review! Seems more like a loaded-with-features crossover than a direct competition to Creta and Seltos! In the league of S Cross with 2021 features!
337,"I drive the Skoda Superb and I can say this car lacks the proper Skoda charm, they have reduced the quality levels here..."
338,Good best
339,"Features ke samne mat bhagna jese ki creta aur seltos 
Agar quality chahiye to skoda se  achha option nahi hey👍 seltos ki 5 star mese 3 star ki rating hey"
340,"bhai Jeep Wrangler ka bhi video banao..
Abhi launch hui h India Main manufacturing bhi hui h"
341,The perfect SUV design for all the SUV in this price range
342,Which Cars Kushaq will compete with.?
343,Seltos sleepless nights are coming
344,"Personally -Better than Seltos 
What say viewers ?"
345,Please get Skoda to add Lapiz Blue or Lava Blue as one of the colour schemes for the Kushaq! Was really hoping they'd do that right at the launch... Fingers crossed : )
346,Without diesel engine? Don't know how much it sell
347,"Should undercut creta then it'll be an attractive package... Despite being smaller, shorter, narrower but mind u feels more premium & plush"
348,video is very blurry.
349,"स्कोडा होता है भाई ,,शकोडा नही"
350,Yeh pitegi buri tarah...suv mein diesel engine ka option bhi hona chahiye...iski width kam hai
351,Aap k time kisi na kisi ka phone mil hi jata hay RR discovery may bhi tah😅😂
352,Indian cost cutting is the real shit in the car industry.
353,very nice walkaround... in fact the best i have seen so far. You touched upon all the relevant points.
354,"If in case the price goes in between 12-17 then India would like to go with Jeep, Tata & Honda 🙂"
355,Flop . Bcz there is no diesel variants
356,sir skoda superb le ke aao please♨♨♨♨♨😉qq
357,Amazing.! Watched on WhatsApp. Came here to like 👍 it.
358,boot space isnt it good for sleeping when we go outings sometime for enjoyment
359,Bhai fortuner ki video banao
360,"Sir, kya space acchi hai 5 logo ke liye ?"
361,i knew the pricing is from 10-17 lacs.
362,I had 2 skoda cars laura and rapid but now only rapid... having skoda experience before was great but now skoda is trying really hard to sustain in indian market... I would never ever buy any skoda car in future.
363,Paice
364,Steering wheel not that attractive looking like old alto
365,Quality dakho
366,"Bhai ke paas 1.5 ltr engine top variant hai, jo autocar ke paas bhi nai hai"
367,"Dct cant touch dsg ever , dsg is the best"
368,"If it launches with aggressive pricing just like rapid , then it will be game changer."
369,385 litres of boot space?! That's it?! Thats very less
370,Is there any options for gear other than manual with clutch.
371,Everything depends on after sales service and Skoda provides the worst after sales service compared to ANY OTHER brand in India. People who buy this car are only going to regret it. I was a skoda owner for 8 yrs and their after sales serbice is garbage
372,"Service pe depend karegi Gagan bhai. Kesi bhi gadi nikal de skoda.Mere pass skoda rapid thi 1st gen wali, kagi pareshaan tha uski service ko leke. Costly or gadi service bhi 2-3 din me hoti thi & aaj bhi inki service aisi hi h."
373,"""Ignis ka Ad aa rha hai isme"" stole my heart ! Epic !!"
374,Digital consol so normal
375,Tpms and front parking sensors available only as accessory? Matlab top model leke bhi we'll have to pay extra?
376,"Namaste gagan sir , plz make the video of Isuzu v-cross🙏"
377,12:56 shut the fu*k up armrest 😂😂😂
378,Pls bring diesel engine
379,The small gap in front of the hand brake and the cup holders is for the key. Not for mobile phones

381,Nice car
382,"People - Škoda Kushaq can defeat creta
Me - thinks of the time when Tata fans told the same about next gen i20 but that never happened"
383,"Sad speedo console. Smaller and cheaper vehicles have better speedo console. No thud, hard plastics, fit and finish not on par with Skoda quality,) is this the outcome of localisation? Why? Just plonking a good engine and sticking a badge won’t make it good overall. Now pricing will decide it’s worth"
384,Asp healthy ho gaye hai our mote ho gaye hai
385,Video not shoot properly I think camera focus issue 😂🤣🤣😂
386,Skoda cars are very solid
387,Better thud to apko swift me aayega bhai
388,"Skoda , Jeep , Fiat , Tata , Volkswagen , Audi , Mahindra&mahindra , Bajaj-KTM , Mercedes , GM/Great wall motors  all these auto giants have their headquarters in & around Pune & Mumbai city in Maharashtra thats why these first unvealed units of cars come with MH01 , MH02 , MH14 , MH12 , MH20 RTO registrations. The reason is Pune and surrounding area has large number of third party OEM Parts supplier Vendors. And very soon KIA Motors India & Hyundai India are also starting their manufacturing plant in Pune Maharashtra. Even Maruti Suzuki of Gurugram had finalised to start manufacturing in Pune Maharashtra but because of political influence it was started in Kapashera & Manesar in Gurgaon Haryana"

399,Arrree vai gari ka overall looks toh dikhao...
400,There's like 6+ inches of headroom and he says headroom is cramped? Ok quite an interesting analysis. Plus can you please confirm if all the windows are not one touch up down? The button for the windows look like it's one touch.

404,"In this segment, Skoda has to get the pricing right. If it can undercut kia pricing by atleast 1.5 lakh per variant then this car can easily sell about 3000 units a month with majority of its units being sold in tier 1 cities. However SV group needs to increase dealerships to tier 2 and tier 3 cities this car will be able to sell about 35k units in a fiscal year. This should be Skodas goal."
405,What happened to illuminated grille and logo? Can I fold the rear seats?
406,Big miss by skoda in interiors...boring gray color of interiors and old fashioned analog instrument cluster..nothing special to compete with other rivals
407,There is a cruise control in the car?
408,Better name this Skoda kostkuttingq
409,Lots of love ❤️
410,Mast nahi laga
411,Price Kay hai ?
412,Namaskar dosto tera nam he gagan
413,When they'll announce the pricing!!??
414,"Look amd feel me very rich lag rhi h, mujhe lgta h seltos ko tagda competition degi."
415,"honest question, why is the title and everything else in english when the actual video is in another language? not trying to start anything just curious, good video otherwise, it looks like a nice car despite the fact that i couldnt understand anything"
416,You are definitely the most in depth Hindi car reviewer on YouTube
417,Yetoh Karoq hey . Couldn't beat Nissan Magnite's design
418,Ye car sab car ki watt laga de gi kusaq se Skoda stand ho jaega
419,2:36 fuel fill karne  ka option hain. 😂
420,Best review of kushaq... All aspects included...
421,Looks small
422,"Never buy a car that offers only a space saver spare tyre. 
Demand from the dealer that they provide you with a full size spare and if they refuse, simply walk away."
423,Will the 1.0 liter engine be priced just above Sonnet and the 1.5 liter engine at Seltos price or 1.0 liter itself will go to Seltos level on Road.. any idea?
424,Car look good not good from inside.
425,10:55 😂😂
426,"Base model should be at 9.99 lacks.
Otherwise other tincans will maintain the 1 leap ahead of it🌝"
427,"No Way !!🤢
Still SMALLER than creta?
Expected 2b bigger than Seltos, 4325 not 4225 !
Šköda ur LÖST!!
India 2.O strategy- double faliüre!!
Who d heck is Leading 2.O
Don't u remember, "" Bada hay toh Behtar hay/ Big is Better""
This is India not E.U., SAFETY 2nd priority SIZE 1st; change ur 5S strategy's From SAFETY to SIZE!!
Moreover ppl here buy ZeGalander Wagan (Merc G-wagon) for SIZE not SAFETY even at ₹25Millon.
BTW which car is 5star safe at headÖNcollision at 100km/hr in the WORLD ?"
428,"What! Front parking sensors optional hai😱  yr Tiago tk mei sensors sbhi variants mei milte hai,"
429,You really great bhai Hyundai Sonata car ki video bano
430,"if this comes at 10 l starting point,  I will sell my 2020 creta to buy this"
431,Kam se kam 22 lack se 30 tak hoge 🙄 15 mi skoda 😉😁😁😂
432,"Educated buyers will definitely prefer this over Creta and Seltos. Cars like Taigun, Karoq, T-Roc, Kushaq, Compass are pure class, safe & have unmatched turbo Petrol Engines."
433,"Why Skoda why? Why didn't you put rear disc brakes. Why :( 
With this launch it's safe to say Taigun will also miss out on rear discs."
434,What great clarity 👍 Great video
435,Diesel option hona chahiye
436,You have more views on kushaq than Autocar india... Impressive
437,"Excellent review Gagan, better than any other today on Kushaq. You have covered minute details as well. Somehow don't feel Skoda has done a wholehearted job. They should have come out full force to outsmart their rivals by providing virtual cockpit, Pano roof, paddle shifters, drive modes, rear sun blinds, all disc brakes and last but not least better boot space. Not sure this will create any dent on Koreans which are still much better equipped. Hanging on to drive and build quality alone won't get them customers I feel."
438,thank god airbags accessories main nahi lagane padhange
439,Do we get ambient lights in the package...???
440,Bhai as always most detailed and best review
441,I guess skoda is experimenting with few cost cutting and cheaper stuff to increase car sales....which is consider good because skoda ka cheap maal bhi kia aur creta ke premium maal se acha hai 🤣👍🏻
442,1.5 liter is naturally aspirated?
443,"HI gagan,  i recently bought used elite i20, Asta 2018 model, but later i found there is no map SD card in AVN. i contacted the owner he said he never used navigation system ever... i also visit nearest Hyundai center but they advise to buy new SD card which cost 9000rs, i'm not ready to spend 9000 just for maps.  is there any alternate that i can get map data and use in 3rd party SD card and use it in AVN system...pls suggest..."
444,"VERY INFORMATIVE 😊 BUT MY CONCERN WAS BACK SEAT HUMP USUALLY ALL VIDEO MAKING PEOPLE MISS THAT, I BELIVE HUMP IS NOT FOUND IN MAHENDRA & HECTOR SUV. IT IS REQUESTED ALWAYS SHOW DETAILED INFORMATION LIKE CAPLESS FUELING ALWAYS OPEN FUEL CAPS,   SHOW THE SIZE OF HUMPS IF THEY EXIST"
445,3:13 Volkswagen??
446,I see at 12 : 19
447,STOP TOUCHING THE CAR WITH THE KEYS IN HAND!
448,"No matter the features or any other gimmicks, at least it will be safest of the lot !!"
449,I think polo has better quality.
450,Pricing decides the future of this car in India.. hope it ends the monopoly of Koreans in this segment..
451,Ek bar Lamborghini urus ka review
452,"Too much of cost cutting 
🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♂️

But lot better than Tata, Suzuki, etc and other unreliable cars."
453,Nice video bro
454,Its no competition to seltos.. Outdated..!
455,Very nicely cover details as always Gagan keep it up 👍🏻
456,3:16 Quality Speaks
457,Kya pyaari gaadi hai
458,How's bulud quality
459,"I was looking to buy a new machine.. going back & forth between the City 5th gen, Ford ecosport & bam this hit my timeline! Looks promising, hopefully they price it right. If the top end is around 18L OR, I’ll definitely be buying this."
460,"VERY DISAPPOINTING, TODAY SKODA LAUNCHED CAR INSTEAD OF SUV."
461,Bro 1.0 litre wil deliver 175 nm of torque🙏👍
462,India 2.0 Strategy still need an update for Skoda.. and if Skoda is offering this I am damn sure VW taigun will come with the same features.. have seen T-cross and Kamiq.. even after Indian manufacturing the have not come closer to the expectation of consumers.. great built but the market is very moderate. Need to understand the demand at this price Skoda could have provided imported car !! Appreciate T-Roc but that too got a massive price hike. What say Gagan Bhai?
463,"In which segment it will compete, like with venue, Ecosport,etc. or with Seltos, Creta?

For me the price range you suggested makes Venue and sonet's top trim better than Kushaq's lower ones and Kushaq top trim will be better than Creta and Seltos's lower trims."
464,It won't sell.........30% Less....just because of panaromic Sunroof............TAKE NOTE
465,Why no digital console?? This is crazy and even no panoramic sunroof !! HARD TO COMPETE WITH CRETA !!
466,Bhai scorpio ki bhi video dalo
467,Price???
468,Is car ki price pakka 17 to 23 lakh tk rahegi
469,I have VW car so I can understand quality of material and fit and finish is top notch.
470,Aap to jaldi pahoch gye bhai
471,Today Watching 4th review video of  kushaq. This is the best review among all videos i have seen. Great work done. 👍😀
472,Not enough to beat seltos tbh.
473,"Kya hoga..
I already owner of Skoda rapid since 2013..
But in uttarakhand have only one showroom ..But last month wo bhi band ho gaya . Ab kehna ye hai ki agra , lucknow , ya jao delhi .
Abe market me launch karne se phele market ho to sell kerne ke liye..
Kon lega ...???"
474,Waiting for vw taigun
475,Gagan bhai please yaar ecosport titanium 21 ka review kr do please
476,Vw is   the best car maker in the world
477,Totally different way of explanation from Bhed Chaal...
478,Bhai Scorpio par bhi video bana do plz
479,3:15 patt se headshot
480,Hmm gagan u forgot about volume nob 😂😂😂
481,Disappointed with Kushaq was expecting bigger. it's another s cross and not a rival to creata and seltos
482,"Dear Gagan, you make videos with such honesty and humbleness. I saw two more videos from motoroctane and ask carguru and both of them messed very well. Your video came late but had it’s own reputation and was the one worth waiting for. Keep it up, always ! 
Miles to go 🤟🏻👌🏻"
483,Price only choose the winner in the segment😂
484,"Skoda says that they want to achieve 5% market share of india when they can't even give the fraction of features given to car's in Europe this is so disappointing that they give all the good features to them in kushaq we don't even get panaromic sunroof,the digital cockpit, and not even soft plastic ... which is given in kamiq and still that hand pulling brake it's 2021!!! with this attitude i don't think the skoda will be able to reach even 1 percent market share, the real problem is expectations which we shouldn't have with them if we don't have them we won't be disappointed ever i had very high hopes from them, they raised up the bar very very high when I saw kamiq and then the vison in now i will never have high hopes from this brand 
🙏"
485,Maruti Swift much better than skoda kushaq and Tata harrier so far.....
486,When is the Amaze Facelift 2021 coming?
487,MID thoda old fashioned lag raha tha jo display ka UI hai usme
488,But I have made up my mind to buy 5th gen Honda City 😃
489,I must say quite a few details covered though it was a first walk-around. Its missing a few features when compared to Creta/Seltos; so prices will have to be quite a bit lower to justify equipment on offer.
490,All features that Kia Seltos provided right back in 2019.
491,This maybe better than Seltos but the 'best mid-section in terms of space utility' in the while mid-suv segment is #Kiger right now hands-down.
492,Most detail review bhai thanks
493,"6:41 ""Ignis Ka Ad aa Raha hai isme"" .. sounds like an Easter egg!"
494,"Rivalry will be really having a sip of beer thinking we have high ground clearance, bigger in dimensions and larger boot space... But keep in mind guys this is German engineering and everything in MQBA0 platform they haven't squeezed they have made really impressive build and ticked all the right boxes. The only bummer I could think of is the ground clearance considering the tag line inspired by India... Let's hope for the price to be on par..."
495,Bahi ye konsa model hai
496,No diesel version ended my hopes 😶
497,Most premium in the segment.
498,Very good review !!
499,"You were featured in its advertisement, it has to be awesome"
500,"Everything depends on pricing. If priced high, then no chance in India❗❗❗"
501,Thanks for this now i can finally buy my splender
502,Gagan bhai please review Yamaha Mt15
503,"I drive polo highline 1.2 L P. The quality is much better in polo, as I can see from the video, skoda has compromised in the quality.. Might be the Dsg model will be better in quality."
504,Nahi chalegi
505,"Disappointed that some features are missing even in the top end variant:-
1. Front parking sensor
2. Rear disc brakes
3. 360° camera
4. Electrically adjustable driver seats."
506,sab kuch optional hai 🤣🤣
507,"can we all apreciate him for staying till late for the review so that his audience gets a proper walkaround without any other reviwers voice in the background.
Kaam bade itminamn se kiya jata hai inse to kaam khoobsurat pe lagta hai apka baki sabse."
508,Expecting its sister(VW TAIGUN) would have better finishings  like better seat covers and quality btw love you gagan Sir #agbg_R.I.P.
509,Instrument console🤨
510,11:00min phone is look like thousand years old🤣🤣🤣
511,Almost all the auto reviewers covered the event and displayed the cars on their respective channels.. but the way you presented is absolutely class. Simply the best
512,"Good review.. but why are you in such a hurry 🤒.. if Skoda can make Rapid at 7 lacs, I don't see same engine to be priced from 12-17 lacs.. why do you feel so, Gagan??  any price break up to justify your suggestion... Is it because the product is new.. where is the competitive edge!! I personally feel that Skoda will loose it's market share if they still try to price this product per your suggestions... Really a competitive product.. only thing required now is pricing it well.. we all know that Skoda is an elephant in terms of cost of ownership.. if buying is equally expansive only followers would join 😀😀 jokes apart.. I hope Skoda can understand 🙏🙏"
513,Veere #JeepGrandCherokee per Ikk video bna Do😔😔...Kya #JeepGrandCherokee 🚘India Mai Aati a ha😊
514,Gaadi ki silhoutte toh dikhi nahi
515,"I think skoda will launch another premium version of kushq in later time 🧐
.
.
Like how tata did with harrier."
516,Use ultra wide camera
517,"Behatareen, shandaar, zindabad!"
518,Much premium than seltos and creta
519,Petrol me 10-11 ki mileage vaali gaddi kon lega bhaiya😂
520,Dhanta Skoda
521,"waiting for Skoda to launch a sub compact suv named ""Lassun""."
522,Back in game bhai itna late
523,Did they just Skipped Keyless entry and push button start ?
524,The interior quality according to your description disappoints.....had better expectations from skoda ... and their India 2.0 strategy would work only if they make it easier and cheaper to maintain a skoda

537,Aap bhi giveaway kyo nhi krte h🙏
538,If this car come at starting price of 12 lakh and top variant around 18 lakh then it will be solid competition other wise in 20 lakh Tata harrier is tough competition for this. Creta and Seltos will suffer in sales due to this no matter what. Love the overall design.

672,"Whatever is the Specs they provide, but they have ""Good Year "" Tyers then it's now Bhagwan Bharosa 
Chale to chaand tak nai tho Raat tak wala. 

The most hopeless and useless tyers company is ""Good Year"""
673,Only in  petrol. No diesel. If it's coming in diesel than it's compete with others. Good looks.
674,Looks like premium
675,If it comes under 15lak ill sell rapid and buy this 👍🏻
676,"Telephone......No No......Mobile phone controls bro.
Telephone sound so cheap"
677,It's price in india is 1 million
678,No electric hand brake 🙄
679,"Sir please suggest my budget is 13laks I'm very confused in buying suv
Sonet htx dct and nexon xz .
We generally use car weekly twice only"
680,"Now confusion increased 
Skoda kushaq, kia seltos , MG hector , and tata harrier 
Which is better 😅"
681,Expected launch date?
682,"Interior quality seems to be low.
Price should start from 9L Max."
683,Bhai zameen pe let ke video shoot kar letaa
684,Sab reviews dekho par asli samajh tera video dekh ke hi aati hai. Now tell us Creta ya Kushaq? :)
685,I am interested this car
686,Very true ..price..as we know manufactured in India..but if they fix even more than 15lakhs then sales figure wil drastically come down...
687,😍
688,Far better than creata and kia seltos
689,boot space is kinda less
690,ugh! interoirs are a cheap shiny mess. awaiting VW Taigun!
691,Please inform about karoq launching date in india
692,If the price is under 20 lacs then this is a fabulous deal
693,Cream colour interior looks more premium than black
694,That ragged phone is v3 cars
695,I am in love with classic styling of Skoda
696,Gagan bhai ye kya Hall bna rakha hai tumne apna bhai koe NASHA TOH NAHI KARTE APNA KHAYAL RAKHNA 👍😂😂😂
697,"Bro , which camera is used in recording?"
698,Yaar camera.. Shi focus ni krta..
699,Does it have park assist??
700,Manual + 1.5 tsi is boom
701,I think price should be 9 lakh to 16 lakh because it is only available in petrol engine
702,"Bhai, mere ko ek baat batao, itna zoomed in position pe camera kyun rakha hai, overall looks dikh nahi raha"
703,Waste car
704,You are my favourite.. 👍👍
705,"Gagan sir, I am a fan of you, you explains each and every detail about the car if it belongs to the car's hardware/software/behaviour and driving pros and cons. I need your suggestion, and I feel you are the best person who can help me to buy my next compact SUV (crossover)/SUV. I am looking for an SUV which has at least a 1900 MM width. I am a bit obese boy so looking for a car in which I could feel comfortable and suits on my personality. Please suggest sir."
706,What is the safety rating of globel ncap
707,Price 9-15 lakh
708,3:43 Observe steering 😂😂
709,The rear wiper should be premium like other cars provide modern day wipers but the rear wiper looks old
710,I think kushaq price will start from 10.59 and new rapid will start from 9.5 lakh ex-showroom
711,Thoda alto quality lagray
712,I love most the Volkswagen T- Roc 1.5 TSI
713,There should be a panoramic sunroof 🙄
714,no cruise control
715,Nice video
716,"Which is technology wise better, VW, Skoda or Hundai, are spare parts of Skoda easily available, is it true that Skoda cars are costly to maintain?"
717,Not in Diesel would be deal braker for 50% buyer
718,Hope they did not compromise with the build quality in the name of cost cutting.
719,Top end price?
720,Bhai Volkswagen group DCT transmission ko DSG nhi bolta dono different gear ⚙ box ha DSG far superior then DCT
721,"Sunroof is given in middle model ,?"
722,Fit and finish is notches above creta
723,"I own a Volkswagen, quality of Skoda Volkswagen is impeccable, I had a Maruti , riding a Maruti gives a feel of a Poor mans car. Any vehicle from Skoda is sturdy, reliable and safe. The only problem is servicing. Skoda Volkswagen need to improve on that.."
724,Poor interior of car
725,Price should not exceed more than 10 lakh...if price is high then no chances most of family in india is hand to mouth
726,Thank you for the detailed tour of the car!
727,If they put up the price up then seltos or creta then they are on the lesser sales sides as their service charges are higher too similarly the case with taigun
728,First show the car fully ..your videos are so close ok
729,If diesel is not offered it can’t make it big
730,Magnite is better then khusaq
731,Still no start stop button.
732,Brother iska price kya hai
733,Skoda should launch 1.2 ltr engine rather than 1 ltr.
734,"Price will be the deciding factor, let's wait ✌🏻"
735,"Waiting for more irritating Nexon, Ecosport owners here to brag about thud sound and compare it with seltos/creta.. you guys should buy a road roller, uske toh tyre bhi iron ke hote hai.. sabko thod degi raaste mei 😀"
736,Launched in India??
737,How is skoda after sales service?
738,Your camera not Good
739,Thank you Gagan bhai
740,Very nice review🙂...Skoda kushaq is very nice car and it will compete with kia seltos and Hyundai Creta.
741,Он что нибудь про стоимость сказал?
742,3:15 ha tod de use😄
743,Subwoofer inside the spare tyre??
744,This is one of the best car build in this segement.We needs to upgrade our standard now .Don't understand why we can buy Hyundai & Maruti with low quality ? I think this will be best option for new generation. Love KUSHAQ
745,Bhai aap konsa car use karte ho
746,What are the direct competitor's for this car
747,Gagan bhaiya skoda karoq ka drive review kab ayega

752,Superb video sir👍
753,Sir how much ground clearance and some such basic featurs missing but solid engineering genrman
754,Skoda kushaq is good quality car
755,Gagan bhai camera work improve karao pls. Thoda wide mein liya karo. Bahut nazdeek se shaots hain kuch samajh nahi aa raha.

761,"Hello Everyone, as i have heard Mr. Zac Hollis in many interviews ....he seems confident about his 2.0 plans.... if Skoda India introduces 1) Premium Hatchback 5 seater (ex. Fabia) = 5.99 for Base - 8.99 for Top Variant.  2) Small SUV (Kushaq - 5 seater) = 7.99 for Base -12.99 for Top Variant. 3) Entry Level sedan 5 seater = 7.49 Base - Top Variant 12.99. 4) Premium Level sedan 12.99 Lac Base - Top Variant 17.99 Lac. 5) Premium SUV 5 Seater = 15.99 Lac Base - Top Variant 18.99 Lac. 6) Entry Level SUV 7 Seater = 19.99 Lac Base - Top Variant 24.99 Lac. if this strategy is followed even only with petrol engines skoda will do a better job in india. The current sales will be doubled in next 2 years and every year the growth of 15-20 % can be seen"

784,Its 17 lakhs on road or ex showroom??
785,🤓🤓🙂
786,How much does this one cost?
787,Skoda is 🔥🔥🔥
788,Skoda is well known for Diesel engines and best fuel efficiency not compromising with build quality. Not sure abt petrol...
789,much better than seltos and creta
790,Kya isme air purifier and perfume dispenser hain
791,Millage range?????
792,Are kya bhai camera blur krte rehte ho all the time usase kuch dikhta nhi. Isliye me unsubscribe ho gya. Tum ab bhi vese hi video banate ho. Blur krna chod do or vo fast movement tumehi achi lagti hogi.. mood pura kharab ho jata he

808,Humesha out of focus hoti hai yeh videos
809,"They'll screw up again with pricing.  They are going after jeep , NOT creta or seltos."
810,Price?
811,What's the expected price ?
812,Ask VW and Skoda India why diesels are not being launched in India even when they are using Euro 6 diesels in Europe.
813,Skoda can win if they intelligently place 2 variants out of 5 under 10L. They can actually out perform everyone with this price strategy.
814,Safety is the only concern.. hopefully they have not compromised on that..
815,If they priced this between 9 to 14 lakhs it will eat creta and seltos
816,"Spare wheel of smaller size is like a very disappointing thing for me 
I believe they could do better in it"
817,What is the kmpl of this car
818,Creata ke sath competition karna hai to price aggressive rakhni hogi skoda ko ..
819,S ii
820,Diesel engine nhi hai ;(
821,Did you see any options on ambient lighting like octavia? Zac Hollis mentioned that kushaq will come with ambient lighting but not a single review covered it so far
822,Grill copied from Kia Seltos
823,I think Skoda and Volkswagen has speciality over Hatchbacks and sedans... but in terms of SUV i think JEEP COMPASS leads!!!
824,Impressive Gaganbhai....keep it up
825,Good review
826,Is it FWD or RWD?
827,I have doubt about build quality.

841,Will it gets uv cut glasses?
842,This is 1.0 l engine right ?
843,Bootspace extra 100 litres means it will win definitely❤️👍
844,VW ki saari cars quality ki to hain ye to mana padega
845,"Skoda and Volkswagen after sale services are horrible and too expensive spare parts.
Better to buy Toyota or Honda more reliable vehicles and they also provide very good safety features.
Dont waste money on these brands.
Can really save lots."

860,"Hey, nice presentation. Can you please tell me about the camera and lens you used to shoot this? The video quality is really great. Thanks!"
861,I Definitely buy this car if it come in diesel.
862,"I would say , Ford  Ecosport still dominates."
863,He talks like he’s going to miss a train. Calm Karja
864,Hey Gagan Make a Video on RE classic 350 & Yamaha MT 15
865,"KIA IS CHEATING INDIAN CUSTOMERS. SELTOS HAS A SAFETY RATING OF 3 ONLY (ACTUALLY JUST 2 ONLY,  2.75 ROUNDING UP TO 3) AND WITH A CABIN STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY RATED AS UNSTABLE!!!!!!!!   CRETA MAY GET THE SAME RATING BECAUSE BOTH SHARE THE SAME PLATFORM. FEARING THAT ,HYUNDAI TILL NOW DID NOT SEND CRETA FOR NCAP CRASH TEST. REMEMBER THAT NEXON WHICH IS A SEGMENT BELOW GOT 5 STARS AND NISSAN MAGNITE GOT 4 STARS. KUSHAQ MAY DEFINITELY GET A 5 STAR RATNG."
866,Skoda should be provide diesel engine..
867,10:50 V3 cars' rugged phone
868,Car looks so premium! Price 😂 india:- baad mah aana...Maruti Alto 800 😎💰
869,I think tata Nexon is better than kushaq
870,Price kab unveil hoga??
871,The sunroof extends further if you keep the button pressed. My fabia has same feature that's why I am saying that.
872,Skoda=audi= volkswagen
873,"Skoda went from names like Octavia Fabia Superb to Karoq Kushaq Kamiq. 

VW went from Polo Jetta Passat to Taigun Tiguan TRoc.

Mahinda and Tata still rolling on with Thar and Safari."
874,Can't beat CRETA
875,"Tell Skoda guys dont be greedy, 1st launch the car with very low price since 90% parts are localization,  rest this youtubers wont make your car premium unless Skoda doesn't think like Maruti
."
876,No one will buythis car...
877,Skoda karoq ki information baatayi .
878,Very pathetic service provided my Skoda india
879,The style is drop dead gorgeous
880,This is made in our home land @aurangabad
881,Was waiting for ur video only finally 🔥🔥 i love it
882,Why Skoda is not coming with diesel engines
883,Sad that this car will fail in front of Creta just coz of the reason that it doesn't have a panaromic roof
884,Car is good but hope Skoda didnt price it just like karoq which make good product flop.
885,I have Skoda rapid tsi service price is effordable and experience is also good ❤️
886,Altroz xz  variant
887,"A Skoda which looks Kia from inside. Quality compromise nhi krna chahiye yr , uske liye hyundai vgerah already hai"
888,Service quality is a big question.
889,"Guys please check the dealer. If he is really trustworthy only then put your foot forward.
After doing so much research on which car we should finally buy, we opted for Skoda Rapid style automatic Petrol, and here are we today regretting for the same.
Think twice before you buy.
After sales service from Skoda is pathetic.
From day one there is some or the other problem but no one to rescue.
Dealer gave me fake price quotation, & cheated more than 75000/- 
Also not gave us the second key of my car. 
Collected 1% TCS i.e. 12000/- as per government norms & didn’t deposited in government till date.
I am feeling completely cheated by Skoda and do not know what to do with my car.
So, request all those who plan to buy Skoda to reconsider their decision and ensure they have adequate reasons to buy."
890,"Very poor and low quality interior, at least for top model quality should have kept better
This looks competition for venue and sonet and not for creta/seltos"
891,"Even though the pricing is competitive, the quality doesn't looks great. There's nothing fascinating about the interiors. That standard set by Creta, Seltos, Harrier and Hector, this doesn't comes close. German car k naam par sub standard product."
892,Skoda 2.0 flop hote hue nazar aah raha hai
893,Seltos>>kushaq
894,Price
895,Skoda kushaq same as look like Creta 2017
896,"Sasura 100/- ltr petrol ho rha h.
Kisi time mein diesel petrol mein 21₹ ka difference hota tha.
Na bhaiya na petrol suit na karega.😂😂"
897,डिझेल चाहिए
898,Bhai all over look bhi gadi ka dikhaya kro achhe se
899,Guys... skoda claims that most parts are indian made... so let's hope from 9 L-16 L lakhs ex showroom
900,"No all one touch window that’s a basic for last model 😑,I’m out for this one (my rapid style is much better than this)😓 disappointed"
901,"10 lac price wil b  very attractive and competitive for all SUV 
Wil create new history if around 10lac price"
902,That instrumental cluster kinda looks outdated.. Except that everything is top notch.
903,Start some more road trips for new channel #Ghumakkadgagan 🤔🤔🤔🤔😂😂😂😂😂

905,"Namaskaar gagan bhai

906,"Gagan, how is khusaq should anyone should wait for it or creta is still the winner and one should go with Creta"
907,It should range not more than 12 lacs as compared to competition in the market
908,I love the skoda design. Elegant and no nonsense designs. If pricing is good this will be my next car
909,Gagan bhai... Kia Seltos version 2 kaap launch hoga? 🤔
910,Skoda mehanga THoda 😜😜
911,Car bahar Se thik se dikhaya bhi nahi hai...
912,Kaha se mil jati hai aapko nayi nayi car
913,What kind of review is this? Why are there comments without familiarising about the features? Amateurish.
914,Arun Panwar :- Kia kyu nahi lii ?
915,Flop show just like Kicks. Its dimensions are on par with Brezza and Venue. They should have squeezed it into Sub 4m or should fight with S cross. No chance against Creta and Seltos
916,Wow! great quality of camera👍🏾
917,Instead of buying this i can spend 2 more lks and go for the beast tata harrier
918,"It's a jackedup fabia. Small, Karoq would have been ideal size. Rather than making a new one, Karoq could have been localised, with an diesel option."
919,Please review jeep compass s top model make complete video on road and off road
920,Aapko video bnani aachi Tarah se Nahi aati

926,"What a stupid feature miss.
Only driver side auto up down. 
Skoda and VW had this very useful feature standard on top variants and I, for one, use and appreciate feature a lot."
927,It should not be priced more than 16 lakhs
928,We want TDI diesel back
929,U cant complain skoda about quality 😁😁.
930,"What's new in this vehicle,even 9 to 11 lakh card like i20 have more features than this kushaq,it can compare with EcoSport and nexon,"
931,If its price between 11 to 16 lac then it becomw succesful but if its price become 12 to 17 lac Chance is very less 😆😆🤘🤘

948,Does NISSAN Magnite MT XV model Non Turbo has hill assistant?
949,Can we expect L&K variant?

the model you are seeing cost around 19-20 lacs on road , that too in petrol....

Real competition against Creta/Seltos would be of :

1002,"Ok so few things almost all the reviewers missed are that this is a Skoda and not a Hyundai of Kia. So features like pan sunroof, digital cockpit, all LED light setup in front and back, smaller bezel and a larger screen for infotainment would come as an update features in upcoming years to keep the car refresh. And Škoda has cleverly kept the relevant features like venti seats and a sunroof to give a dent to rivals. Maybe Škoda should roll a VRS variant as well 😅."
1003,1 litter engine torq is 175 nm
1004,If on road 12 to 18...this is the car U have to buy instead creta and seltos
1005,Creta still stands tall 🤟🏻🔥. If this is the top model here then even creta sx provides better vfm than this.
1006,Nice review! Seems more like a loaded-with-features crossover than a direct competition to Creta and Seltos! In the league of S Cross with 2021 features!
1007,"I drive the Skoda Superb and I can say this car lacks the proper Skoda charm, they have reduced the quality levels here..."
1008,Good best
1009,"Features ke samne mat bhagna jese ki creta aur seltos 
Agar quality chahiye to skoda se  achha option nahi hey👍 seltos ki 5 star mese 3 star ki rating hey"
1010,"bhai Jeep Wrangler ka bhi video banao..
Abhi launch hui h India Main manufacturing bhi hui h"
1011,The perfect SUV design for all the SUV in this price range
1012,Which Cars Kushaq will compete with.?
1013,Seltos sleepless nights are coming
1014,"Personally -Better than Seltos 
What say viewers ?"
1015,Please get Skoda to add Lapiz Blue or Lava Blue as one of the colour schemes for the Kushaq! Was really hoping they'd do that right at the launch... Fingers crossed : )
1016,Without diesel engine? Don't know how much it sell
1017,"Should undercut creta then it'll be an attractive package... Despite being smaller, shorter, narrower but mind u feels more premium & plush"
1018,video is very blurry.
1019,"स्कोडा होता है भाई ,,शकोडा नही"
1020,Yeh pitegi buri tarah...suv mein diesel engine ka option bhi hona chahiye...iski width kam hai
1021,Aap k time kisi na kisi ka phone mil hi jata hay RR discovery may bhi tah😅😂
1022,Indian cost cutting is the real shit in the car industry.
1023,very nice walkaround... in fact the best i have seen so far. You touched upon all the relevant points.
1024,"If in case the price goes in between 12-17 then India would like to go with Jeep, Tata & Honda 🙂"
1025,Flop . Bcz there is no diesel variants
1026,sir skoda superb le ke aao please♨♨♨♨♨😉qq
1027,Amazing.! Watched on WhatsApp. Came here to like 👍 it.
1028,boot space isnt it good for sleeping when we go outings sometime for enjoyment
1029,Bhai fortuner ki video banao
1030,"Sir, kya space acchi hai 5 logo ke liye ?"
1031,i knew the pricing is from 10-17 lacs.
1032,I had 2 skoda cars laura and rapid but now only rapid... having skoda experience before was great but now skoda is trying really hard to sustain in indian market... I would never ever buy any skoda car in future.

1034,Steering wheel not that attractive looking like old alto
1035,Quality dakho
1036,"Bhai ke paas 1.5 ltr engine top variant hai, jo autocar ke paas bhi nai hai"
1037,"Dct cant touch dsg ever , dsg is the best"
1038,"If it launches with aggressive pricing just like rapid , then it will be game changer."
1039,385 litres of boot space?! That's it?! Thats very less
1040,Is there any options for gear other than manual with clutch.
1041,Everything depends on after sales service and Skoda provides the worst after sales service compared to ANY OTHER brand in India. People who buy this car are only going to regret it. I was a skoda owner for 8 yrs and their after sales serbice is garbage
1042,"Service pe depend karegi Gagan bhai. Kesi bhi gadi nikal de skoda.Mere pass skoda rapid thi 1st gen wali, kagi pareshaan tha uski service ko leke. Costly or gadi service bhi 2-3 din me hoti thi & aaj bhi inki service aisi hi h."

Me - thinks of the time when Tata fans told the same about next gen i20 but that never happened"
1053,"Sad speedo console. Smaller and cheaper vehicles have better speedo console. No thud, hard plastics, fit and finish not on par with Skoda quality,) is this the outcome of localisation? Why? Just plonking a good engine and sticking a badge won’t make it good overall. Now pricing will decide it’s worth"

1058,"Skoda , Jeep , Fiat , Tata , Volkswagen , Audi , Mahindra&mahindra , Bajaj-KTM , Mercedes , GM/Great wall motors  all these auto giants have their headquarters in & around Pune & Mumbai city in Maharashtra thats why these first unvealed units of cars come with MH01 , MH02 , MH14 , MH12 , MH20 RTO registrations. The reason is Pune and surrounding area has large number of third party OEM Parts supplier Vendors. And very soon KIA Motors India & Hyundai India are also starting their manufacturing plant in Pune Maharashtra. Even Maruti Suzuki of Gurugram had finalised to start manufacturing in Pune Maharashtra but because of political influence it was started in Kapashera & Manesar in Gurgaon Haryana"

1074,"In this segment, Skoda has to get the pricing right. If it can undercut kia pricing by atleast 1.5 lakh per variant then this car can easily sell about 3000 units a month with majority of its units being sold in tier 1 cities. However SV group needs to increase dealerships to tier 2 and tier 3 cities this car will be able to sell about 35k units in a fiscal year. This should be Skodas goal."
1075,What happened to illuminated grille and logo? Can I fold the rear seats?

Demand from the dealer that they provide you with a full size spare and if they refuse, simply walk away."
1093,Will the 1.0 liter engine be priced just above Sonnet and the 1.5 liter engine at Seltos price or 1.0 liter itself will go to Seltos level on Road.. any idea?

1100,"if this comes at 10 l starting point,  I will sell my 2020 creta to buy this"
1101,Kam se kam 22 lack se 30 tak hoge 🙄 15 mi skoda 😉😁😁😂
1102,"Educated buyers will definitely prefer this over Creta and Seltos. Cars like Taigun, Karoq, T-Roc, Kushaq, Compass are pure class, safe & have unmatched turbo Petrol Engines."
1103,"Why Skoda why? Why didn't you put rear disc brakes. Why :( 
With this launch it's safe to say Taigun will also miss out on rear discs."
1104,What great clarity 👍 Great video
1105,Diesel option hona chahiye
1106,You have more views on kushaq than Autocar india... Impressive
1107,"Excellent review Gagan, better than any other today on Kushaq. You have covered minute details as well. Somehow don't feel Skoda has done a wholehearted job. They should have come out full force to outsmart their rivals by providing virtual cockpit, Pano roof, paddle shifters, drive modes, rear sun blinds, all disc brakes and last but not least better boot space. Not sure this will create any dent on Koreans which are still much better equipped. Hanging on to drive and build quality alone won't get them customers I feel."
1108,thank god airbags accessories main nahi lagane padhange
1109,Do we get ambient lights in the package...???
1110,Bhai as always most detailed and best review
1111,I guess skoda is experimenting with few cost cutting and cheaper stuff to increase car sales....which is consider good because skoda ka cheap maal bhi kia aur creta ke premium maal se acha hai 🤣👍🏻
1112,1.5 liter is naturally aspirated?
1113,"HI gagan,  i recently bought used elite i20, Asta 2018 model, but later i found there is no map SD card in AVN. i contacted the owner he said he never used navigation system ever... i also visit nearest Hyundai center but they advise to buy new SD card which cost 9000rs, i'm not ready to spend 9000 just for maps.  is there any alternate that i can get map data and use in 3rd party SD card and use it in AVN system...pls suggest..."
1114,"VERY INFORMATIVE 😊 BUT MY CONCERN WAS BACK SEAT HUMP USUALLY ALL VIDEO MAKING PEOPLE MISS THAT, I BELIVE HUMP IS NOT FOUND IN MAHENDRA & HECTOR SUV. IT IS REQUESTED ALWAYS SHOW DETAILED INFORMATION LIKE CAPLESS FUELING ALWAYS OPEN FUEL CAPS,   SHOW THE SIZE OF HUMPS IF THEY EXIST"
1115,3:13 Volkswagen??
1116,I see at 12 : 19
1117,STOP TOUCHING THE CAR WITH THE KEYS IN HAND!
1118,"No matter the features or any other gimmicks, at least it will be safest of the lot !!"
1119,I think polo has better quality.
1120,Pricing decides the future of this car in India.. hope it ends the monopoly of Koreans in this segment..
1121,Ek bar Lamborghini urus ka review
1122,"Too much of cost cutting 
🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♂️

But lot better than Tata, Suzuki, etc and other unreliable cars."
1123,Nice video bro
1124,Its no competition to seltos.. Outdated..!
1125,Very nicely cover details as always Gagan keep it up 👍🏻
1126,3:16 Quality Speaks
1127,Kya pyaari gaadi hai
1128,How's bulud quality
1129,"I was looking to buy a new machine.. going back & forth between the City 5th gen, Ford ecosport & bam this hit my timeline! Looks promising, hopefully they price it right. If the top end is around 18L OR, I’ll definitely be buying this."
1130,"VERY DISAPPOINTING, TODAY SKODA LAUNCHED CAR INSTEAD OF SUV."
1131,Bro 1.0 litre wil deliver 175 nm of torque🙏👍
1132,India 2.0 Strategy still need an update for Skoda.. and if Skoda is offering this I am damn sure VW taigun will come with the same features.. have seen T-cross and Kamiq.. even after Indian manufacturing the have not come closer to the expectation of consumers.. great built but the market is very moderate. Need to understand the demand at this price Skoda could have provided imported car !! Appreciate T-Roc but that too got a massive price hike. What say Gagan Bhai?
1133,"In which segment it will compete, like with venue, Ecosport,etc. or with Seltos, Creta?

For me the price range you suggested makes Venue and sonet's top trim better than Kushaq's lower ones and Kushaq top trim will be better than Creta and Seltos's lower trims."
1134,It won't sell.........30% Less....just because of panaromic Sunroof............TAKE NOTE
1135,Why no digital console?? This is crazy and even no panoramic sunroof !! HARD TO COMPETE WITH CRETA !!
1136,Bhai scorpio ki bhi video dalo
1137,Price???
1138,Is car ki price pakka 17 to 23 lakh tk rahegi
1139,I have VW car so I can understand quality of material and fit and finish is top notch.
1140,Aap to jaldi pahoch gye bhai
1141,Today Watching 4th review video of  kushaq. This is the best review among all videos i have seen. Great work done. 👍😀
1142,Not enough to beat seltos tbh.
1143,"Kya hoga..
I already owner of Skoda rapid since 2013..
But in uttarakhand have only one showroom ..But last month wo bhi band ho gaya . Ab kehna ye hai ki agra , lucknow , ya jao delhi .
Abe market me launch karne se phele market ho to sell kerne ke liye..
Kon lega ...???"
1144,Waiting for vw taigun
1145,Gagan bhai please yaar ecosport titanium 21 ka review kr do please
1146,Vw is   the best car maker in the world
1147,Totally different way of explanation from Bhed Chaal...
1148,Bhai Scorpio par bhi video bana do plz
1149,3:15 patt se headshot
1150,Hmm gagan u forgot about volume nob 😂😂😂
1151,Disappointed with Kushaq was expecting bigger. it's another s cross and not a rival to creata and seltos
1152,"Dear Gagan, you make videos with such honesty and humbleness. I saw two more videos from motoroctane and ask carguru and both of them messed very well. Your video came late but had it’s own reputation and was the one worth waiting for. Keep it up, always ! 
Miles to go 🤟🏻👌🏻"
1153,Price only choose the winner in the segment😂
1154,"Skoda says that they want to achieve 5% market share of india when they can't even give the fraction of features given to car's in Europe this is so disappointing that they give all the good features to them in kushaq we don't even get panaromic sunroof,the digital cockpit, and not even soft plastic ... which is given in kamiq and still that hand pulling brake it's 2021!!! with this attitude i don't think the skoda will be able to reach even 1 percent market share, the real problem is expectations which we shouldn't have with them if we don't have them we won't be disappointed ever i had very high hopes from them, they raised up the bar very very high when I saw kamiq and then the vison in now i will never have high hopes from this brand 
🙏"
1155,Maruti Swift much better than skoda kushaq and Tata harrier so far.....
1156,When is the Amaze Facelift 2021 coming?
1157,MID thoda old fashioned lag raha tha jo display ka UI hai usme
1158,But I have made up my mind to buy 5th gen Honda City 😃
1159,I must say quite a few details covered though it was a first walk-around. Its missing a few features when compared to Creta/Seltos; so prices will have to be quite a bit lower to justify equipment on offer.
1160,All features that Kia Seltos provided right back in 2019.
1161,This maybe better than Seltos but the 'best mid-section in terms of space utility' in the while mid-suv segment is #Kiger right now hands-down.
1162,Most detail review bhai thanks
1163,"6:41 ""Ignis Ka Ad aa Raha hai isme"" .. sounds like an Easter egg!"
1164,"Rivalry will be really having a sip of beer thinking we have high ground clearance, bigger in dimensions and larger boot space... But keep in mind guys this is German engineering and everything in MQBA0 platform they haven't squeezed they have made really impressive build and ticked all the right boxes. The only bummer I could think of is the ground clearance considering the tag line inspired by India... Let's hope for the price to be on par..."
1165,Bahi ye konsa model hai
1166,No diesel version ended my hopes 😶
1167,Most premium in the segment.
1168,Very good review !!
1169,"You were featured in its advertisement, it has to be awesome"
1170,"Everything depends on pricing. If priced high, then no chance in India❗❗❗"
1171,Thanks for this now i can finally buy my splender
1172,Gagan bhai please review Yamaha Mt15
1173,"I drive polo highline 1.2 L P. The quality is much better in polo, as I can see from the video, skoda has compromised in the quality.. Might be the Dsg model will be better in quality."
1174,Nahi chalegi
1175,"Disappointed that some features are missing even in the top end variant:-
1. Front parking sensor
2. Rear disc brakes
3. 360° camera
4. Electrically adjustable driver seats."
1176,sab kuch optional hai 🤣🤣
1177,"can we all apreciate him for staying till late for the review so that his audience gets a proper walkaround without any other reviwers voice in the background.
Kaam bade itminamn se kiya jata hai inse to kaam khoobsurat pe lagta hai apka baki sabse."
1178,Expecting its sister(VW TAIGUN) would have better finishings  like better seat covers and quality btw love you gagan Sir #agbg_R.I.P.
1179,Instrument console🤨
1180,11:00min phone is look like thousand years old🤣🤣🤣
1181,Almost all the auto reviewers covered the event and displayed the cars on their respective channels.. but the way you presented is absolutely class. Simply the best
1182,"Good review.. but why are you in such a hurry 🤒.. if Skoda can make Rapid at 7 lacs, I don't see same engine to be priced from 12-17 lacs.. why do you feel so, Gagan??  any price break up to justify your suggestion... Is it because the product is new.. where is the competitive edge!! I personally feel that Skoda will loose it's market share if they still try to price this product per your suggestions... Really a competitive product.. only thing required now is pricing it well.. we all know that Skoda is an elephant in terms of cost of ownership.. if buying is equally expansive only followers would join 😀😀 jokes apart.. I hope Skoda can understand 🙏🙏"
1183,Veere #JeepGrandCherokee per Ikk video bna Do😔😔...Kya #JeepGrandCherokee 🚘India Mai Aati a ha😊
1184,Gaadi ki silhoutte toh dikhi nahi
1185,"I think skoda will launch another premium version of kushq in later time 🧐
.
.
Like how tata did with harrier."
1186,Use ultra wide camera
1187,"Behatareen, shandaar, zindabad!"
1188,Much premium than seltos and creta
1189,Petrol me 10-11 ki mileage vaali gaddi kon lega bhaiya😂
1190,Dhanta Skoda
1191,"waiting for Skoda to launch a sub compact suv named ""Lassun""."
1192,Back in game bhai itna late
1193,Did they just Skipped Keyless entry and push button start ?
1194,The interior quality according to your description disappoints.....had better expectations from skoda ... and their India 2.0 strategy would work only if they make it easier and cheaper to maintain a skoda
1195,"Main allready Feb 25 ko book kardiya, yeh mara dream car hai.. apke jaisa detailed review koi nahi kiye. Spl thanks for""U"" bro ❤️"
1196,My next car.... ❤️
1197,"Finally a car in India worth paying for.

1201,9 lakh to 12 lakh ki car hai ye
1202,Nice gagan bhai
1203,Ye model kamse kam 13-14 lakh ka hoga
1204,Drum break no thanks
1205,It will become king of the segment😎
1206,How is watching in 🌃
1207,Aap bhi giveaway kyo nhi krte h🙏
1208,If this car come at starting price of 12 lakh and top variant around 18 lakh then it will be solid competition other wise in 20 lakh Tata harrier is tough competition for this. Creta and Seltos will suffer in sales due to this no matter what. Love the overall design.
1209,"After this video, I'll watch ""How to become a millionaire in 15 days"""

1220,"No signs of 360 camera, electric tail gate ?"
1221,"what happened to you bhai? atleast give 1 frame view of every angles

1222,Watching this video after India's first innings vs England. What a perfect time to watch this time. 15 minutes innings break enjoying with this 15 minutes video.
1223,It looks an average product with European cost. Not an outstanding suv/car
1224,bhai puri gadi bahar se dikhaya karo pura camera chipka dete ho
1225,I am going to buy this car before 2030
1226,"Diesel engine cahiye tha😑😑
